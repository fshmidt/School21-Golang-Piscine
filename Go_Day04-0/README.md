- Your programs should not quit unexpectedly (giving an error on a valid input). If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work won't have to be submitted and won't be graded. It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peers' work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded.
- If your code is using external dependencies, it should use [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) for managing them

<h2 id="chapter-ii" >Chapter II</h2>
<h2 id="rules-of-the-day" >Rules of the day</h2>

- You should only turn in `*.go` files and (in case of external dependencies) `go.mod` + `go.sum`
- Your code for this task should be buildable with just `go build`
- Even though it is required to not modify the C code, you'll still have to comment out `main()` function in it, otherwise the program won't compile (two entry points)

<h2 id="intro" >Intro</h2>

Mister Rogers is very sad. He's sitting at your office and mumbles "My whole business...How am I supposed to make people happy now?".

The story is as old as the world itself. This new client of yours started a new business selling candy all across this muddy town. At first, everything was perfect - several vending machines, 5 delicious kinds of candy and lines of children begging their parents to buy some for them. And then it was like a thunder, when someone broke into a data center and stole a server responsible for handling candy orders. Not only that, an old developer has gone missing, too! Coincidence? You don't think so.

You pour mister Rogers a glass of good old bourbon and start asking questions trying to get more details.

"Well, I don't know much. All our vending machines were selling the same set of candy, you know, here they are on the brochure" - he gives you the piece of colorful paper advertising five new amazing tastes:

```
Cool Eskimo: 10 cents
Apricot Aardvark: 15 cents
Natural Tiger: 17 cents
Dazzling 	Elderberry: 21 cents
Yellow Rambutan: 23 cents
```

"That's some weird sounding names" - you say - "How do people even remember these things?"
"Oh, that one's easy" - said Rogers - "We've been using abbreviations everywhere, including our source code, so it's CE, AA, NT and so on"

He sobs.

"But does this even matter now? My business is ruined anyway, all this is just nonsense now!"

"Please focus, mister Rogers" - you've seen guys behaving like this many times, this place isn't called "Gopher PI" for nothing - "Is there any detail you didn't mention yet?"

"You're right! I've almost forgot!" - he pulls a piece of paper out of the pocket and hands it over. - "The thief left a note!"

You look at the text written with marker on one side: "I can't eat any more candy!". This doesn't give you much. Then you turn over the sheet and...

"Okay, mister Rogers. The good news is, I now know for sure it was your ex-employee who stole the server. But not only that! Something tells me I can help you restore your business, too."

<h2 id="chapter-iv" >Chapter IV</h2>
<h3 id="ex00">Exercise 00: Catching the Fortune</h3>

Turns out, the thief used the first piece of paper he had on his desk, and by a happy coincidence it was a specification for a protocol between vending machine and a server. It looked like this:

```yaml
---
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Candy Server
paths:
  /buy_candy:
    post:
      consumes:

          schema:
            type: object
            required:
              - money
              - candyType
              - candyCount
            properties:
              money:

                type: string
              candyCount:
                description: number of candy
                type: integer
      operationId: buyCandy
      responses:
        201:
          description: purchase succesful
          schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                thanks:
                  type: string
                change:
                  type: integer
        400:
          description: some error in input data
          schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                error:
                  type: string
        402:
          description: not enough money
          schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                error:
                  type: string
```

In next hours, mister Rogers told you all the details. In order to recreate the server, you have to use this spec to produce a bunch of Go code which will actually implement the backend part. It's possible to rewrite the whole thing manually, but in this case the thief may get away before you do it, so you have to generate the code ASAP.

Every candy buyer puts in money, chooses which kind of candy to purchase and how many. This data is being sent over to the server via HTTP and JSON and then:

1) If the sum of candy prices (see Chapter 1) is smaller or equal to the amount of money the buyer gave to a machine, the server responds with HTTP 201 and returns a JSON with two fields - "thanks" saying "Thank you!" and "change" being the amount of change the machine has to give back the customer.
2) If the sum is larger that the amount of money provided, the server responds with HTTP 402 and an error message in JSON saying "You need {amount} more money!", where {amount} is the difference between the provided and expected.
3) If the client provided a negative candyCount or wrong candyType (remember - all five candy types are encoded by two letters, so it's one of "CE", "AA", "NT", "DE" or "YR", all other cases are considered non-valid) then the server should respond with 400 and an error inside JSON describing what had gone wrong. You can actually do it in two different ways - it's either write the code manually with these checks or modify the Swagger spec above so it would cover these cases.

Remember - all data from both client and server should be in JSON, so you can test your server like this, for example:

```
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"money": 20, "candyType": "AA", "candyCount": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:3333/buy_candy

{"change":5,"thanks":"Thank you!"}
```

or

```
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"money": 46, "candyType": "YR", "candyCount": 2}' http://127.0.0.1:3333/buy_candy

{"change":0,"thanks":"Thank you!"}
```

Also, you don't need to keep track of stock of different types of candy yourself, just consider this being done by machines themselves. Just validate user input and calculate the change.

<h3 id="ex01">Exercise 01: Law and Order</h3>

You lay back and smile feeling something that seemed to be the case well cooked. Mister Rogers seems to relax a little, too. But then his face changes again.

"I know we've already paid for increased security at our datacenter" - he said a bit thoughtfully. - "...but what if this criminal desides to perform some [Man-in-the-middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) trickery? My business will be destroyed again! People will lose their jobs abd I'll get bankrupt!"

"Easy there, good sir" - you say with a smirk. - "I think I've got just what you need here."

So, you need to implement a certificate authentication for the server as well as a test client which will be able to query your API using a self-signed certificate and a local security authority to "verify" it on both sides.

You already have a server which supports TLS, but it is possible that you'll have to re-generate the code specifying an additional parameter, so it will be using use secure URLs.

Also, you'll need a local "certificate authority" to manage certificates. For our task [minica](https://github.com/jsha/minica) seems like a good enough solution. There is a link to a really helpful video in last Chapter if you want to know more details about how Go works with secure connections.

So, because we're talking a full-blown mutual TLS authentication, you'll have to generate two cert/key pairs - one for the server and one for the client. Minica will also generate a CA file called `minica.pem` for you which you'll need to plug into your client somehow (your auto-generated server should already support specifying CA file as well as `key.pem` and `cert.pem` through command line parameters). Also, generating certificate may require you to use a domain instead of an IP address, so in examples below we will use "candy.tld". For it to work on a local machine you can put it into '/etc/hosts' file.

Keep in mind, that because you're using a custom local CA you likely won't be able to query your API using cURL, web browser or tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) anymore without tuning.

Your test client should support flags '-k' (accepts two-letter abbreviation for the candy type), '-c' (count of candy to buy) and '-m' (amount of money you "gave to machine"). So, the "buying request" should look like this:

```
~$ ./candy-client -k AA -c 2 -m 50
Thank you! Your change is 20
```

<h2 id="chapter-vi" >Chapter VI</h2>
<h3 id="ex02">Exercise 02: Old Cow</h3>

In a few days mister Rogers finally calls you with some great news - the thief was apprehended and immediately confessed! But candy businessman also had a small request.

"You seem like you really do know your way around machines, don't ya? There is one last thing I'd ask you to do, basically nothing. Our customers prefer something funny instead of just plain 'thank you', so my nephew Patrick wrote a program that generates some weird animal saying things. I think it's written in C, but that's not a problem for you, isn't it? Please don't change the code, Patrick is still improving it!"

Oh boy. You look through your emails and notice one from mister Rogers with a code attached to it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

unsigned int i;
unsigned int argscharcount = 0;

char *ask_cow(char phrase[]) {
  int phrase_len = strlen(phrase);
  char *buf = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * (160 + (phrase_len + 2) * 3));
  strcpy(buf, " ");

  for (i = 0; i < phrase_len + 2; ++i) {
    strcat(buf, "_");
  }

  strcat(buf, "\n< ");
  strcat(buf, phrase);
  strcat(buf, " ");
  strcat(buf, ">\n ");

  for (i = 0; i < phrase_len + 2; ++i) {
    strcat(buf, "-");
  }
  strcat(buf, "\n");
  strcat(buf, "        \\   ^__^\n");
  strcat(buf, "         \\  (oo)\\_______\n");
  strcat(buf, "            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n");
  strcat(buf, "                ||----w |\n");
  strcat(buf, "                ||     ||\n");
  return buf;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  for (i = 1; i < argc; ++i) {
    argscharcount += (strlen(argv[i]) + 1);
  }
  argscharcount = argscharcount + 1;

  char *phrase = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * argscharcount);
  strcpy(phrase, argv[1]);

  for (i = 2; i < argc; ++i) {
    strcat(phrase, " ");
    strcat(phrase, argv[i]);
  }
  char *cow = ask_cow(phrase);
  printf("%s", cow);
  free(phrase);
  free(cow);
  return 0;
}
```

Looks like you'll have to return an ASCII-powered cow as a text in "thanks" field in response. When querying by cURL it will look like this:

```
~$ curl -s --key cert/client/key.pem --cert cert/client/cert.pem --cacert cert/minica.pem -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"candyType": "NT", "candyCount": 2, "money": 34}' "https://candy.tld:3333/buy_candy"
{"change":0,"thanks":" ____________\n< Thank you! >\n ------------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n"}

```

Apparently, all you need is to reuse this `ask_cow()` C function without rewriting it in your Go code.

"Sometimes I think I have to drop this detective work and just go work as a Senior Engineer" - you grumble.

At least you should probably have as much candy as you want in return. Like, for the rest of your life.
